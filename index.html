    <p>At the age of 6 had to play with motors and 1.5 volt battery. Than i started to play with 9 volt . After some years I started to play with many things like 12 volt. When the lockground started once I saw a news paper which is related programming . I read about a app which is Programmig Hero. There I got a web devlopment. I asked my sister about web devlopment. Then he tought me besic of HTML.And I started web devlopment course at Programming Hero. Thats why you are able to read this web site !</p>

    <p>When I was too small I wanted to be an electrical engineer.
        But when I was 12, my mind says to be a softwere engineer.
        And I am confused.
        So i will chose it later but it is sure that i will be an engineer.
        Please pray for me so that I can achive my goal.
